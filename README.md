# White Rabbit
To analyse the degree of distortions, windows apperture of zeolite windows from CAR or PDB files.
The algorithm automatically detects the rings of the structures and performs statistics on them: area, distortions, ellipticities and characteristic distances.

Falling down the rabbit hole!
